Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:
=begin
what is != and where should you use it?

means not equals, so use it when comparing to 
something you don't want it to equal. 

put ! before something, like !user_name
Means not, or falsify, basically give me the 
opposite of what is true for that variable. 

put ! after something, like words.uniq!
denotes the method mutates the caller

put ? before something
Ternanry operator for the if else. 

put ? after something
good for method names, when you are checking something 

put !! before something, like !!user_name
turns it into their boolean equivalent 

=end
